Your Ultimate Configuration Management Tool

Tired of juggling multiple JSON files and text editors to configure your SPT mods? Say hello to the SPT Mod Config Editor - a sleek, modern desktop application that puts all your mod configurations in one beautiful interface.

Key Features:

- One-Click Scanning - Point to your SPT folder and instantly see all your installed mods with their config files
- Smart Editor - Real-time JSON/JSON5 validation ensures you never save a broken config again
- Safe & Reliable - Auto-formatting and validation before saving prevents configuration errors
- Powerful Search - Quickly find any mod with instant search and filtering
- Favorites System - Pin your frequently edited mods for quick access
- Bulk Export - Export all your configurations at once for easy backup or sharing
- Modern UI - Clean, intuitive interface that's a pleasure to use
- Lightning Fast - Built with modern web technologies for instant responsiveness
- Dark/Light Theme Toggle - Added theme switcher with light mode, dark mode, and system preference options. Toggle located next to the Pack & Export button. (For those who love blinding their eyes XD)
- Edit Tracking & Visual Indicators - Mods that have been edited now display an “Edited” badge and show when they were last modified (e.g., “5 minutes ago”).
- Recently Edited Tab - New “Recent” tab in the mod list shows your most recently edited mods for quick access.
- Keyboard Shortcuts - Added Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac) to save configurations and Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac) to focus the search bar. (Let me know if you enjoy this feature)
- Configuration History & Rollback - Every save now creates a backup. Use the new “History” button in the config editor to view previous versions and restore them if needed. Keeps up to 10 versions per config file for the last 30 days. (I think don’t quote me on that)

Perfect For YOU! and for:

Players who frequently tweak mod settings.
Anyone who wants a better way to manage their SPT mods.
No more hunting through folder structures or worrying about syntax errors. Just select your SPT folder and start editing with confidence.

I will be updating things as i go, and add any features the community wants! Happy editing - ifunsUniverse :)
